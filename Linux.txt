-> tcpdump -c 20 : limit the packets to 20.

-> tcpdump -i <eth_name> -c 20 > save.txt : to save the packets into file.

[Note : if we don't use '>>' instead we use only '>' then, previous info will erased.]

->ctr / crictl : used to communicate  directly with container of any type.
                 But, ctr is majorly for containerd. 
->journalctl: it used to store the logs for systemd.

[Systemd: at the time boot up, the hardware initializes andin kernel's RAM OS is being loaded the request goes to systemd, now the service will be run by it.]
