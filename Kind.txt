   Kind

=> It is a type of cluster creation like minikube, where we can run kubernetes clusters locally using Kind.


Installation: 
choco install kind

Get Started:
-> kind create cluster --name <cluster_name> : to create a cluster with a single node only.

[Note: to create multiple node cluster, we can configure it using yaml files, like we do in GKE.]

-> kind get clusters : returns available/created clusters.

-> kind create cluster --name <cluster_name> --config config.yaml : to create a cluster based on the yaml file.
