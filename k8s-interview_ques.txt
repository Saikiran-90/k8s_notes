1. If you delete the cluster, do all resources on it will be deleted?
=> No, excpet persistent volume, everything get deleted.
   Reason is to avoid the data loss on pv.

2. How nodes are defined to particular pod to run?
=> Most of the time the algorithm works as, the node which has more resources unused the pod     is scheduled to that node, internally the balance is maintained. 
   If multiple nodes have same resources then the scheduling is randomized.

3.  Why Ingress terminate SSL?
=> termination of SSL mean decrypting the traffic, 
   So Ingress decrypt the traffic before sending it to the backend,
   which helps to reduce the load on servers.

4. Why doesn't etcd store encrypted data? 
Reason: Storing encrypted data in etcd adds additional overhead, and etcd is typically deployed in secure environments.

5. Why doesn't the Kubernetes Controller Manager rely on Kubelet? 
Reason: The Kubernetes Controller Manager (KCM) manages resources at the cluster level, whereas Kubelet manages the lifecycle of individual pods and does not maintain a complete view of the entire cluster.


Deployments:
A Deployment manages a set of identical Pods, ensuring that a specified number of Pods are running at all times.
When you create a Deployment, Kubernetes creates ReplicaSets, which in turn create the actual Pods.

ReplicaSets:
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are running. It creates and manages these Pods based on a template.
When you create a ReplicaSet, Kubernetes directly creates the corresponding Pods.

StatefulSets:
A StatefulSet is used for managing stateful applications. It ensures that Pods are created with unique, stable identities and persistent storage.
When you create a StatefulSet, Kubernetes creates Pods with consistent network identities and stable storage.

DaemonSets:
A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on every node (or a subset of nodes) in the cluster.
When you create a DaemonSet, Kubernetes creates a Pod on each selected node.
Jobs and CronJobs:

A Job creates Pods that run to completion, usually for batch processing tasks.
A CronJob creates Jobs on a scheduled basis, which in turn create Pods.
Services:

Although Services are not directly responsible for creating Pods, they abstract the networking and allow communication between different sets of Pods.

6. Why NodePort type service is dangerous?
 => In Nodeport we have to open a static IP, so with this all ports of the node will be opened, due to which any backdoor 
    entry is possible by anyone if restrictions to that port is not defined. In this case in many big tech companies nodeport is restricted.
